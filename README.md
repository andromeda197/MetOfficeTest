Here is my solution to the sheilding and wiring task. To see the results, clone the repository, open the 'Main.py' file in your IDE and compile. To change the text file that the program reads open 'StreamReader.py' and change the name of the txt file on line 3. 

I look forward to discussing this during the interview next Monday.

Kind regards 

Brandon.
